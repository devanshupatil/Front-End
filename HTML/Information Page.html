    <h1>How does an About Us page help your business and SEO?</h1>

    <p> We already mentioned that your About Us page is foundational to your website. That's because customers expect it
        and look for it whenever they visit a new-to-them brand online.</p>

    <p>People generally rank the About Us page as the second-most important element on your site (only contact
        information is rated higher in importance).</p>

        alt="About Us" width="600" height="400">

    <p>For comparison, it rates higher than product images and videos, live chat, social media icons/links, and even a
        blog.</p>
    <P> That’s reason enough to create a great About Us page. However, there are even more benefits to creating one that
        might not have crossed your mind.</P>

    <h4> Brand transparency</h4>
    <p> Transparency matters to customers. They want to know how you operate, what goes on behind the scenes, and that
        you’re true to your word. </p>
    <p> 86% of U.S. consumers believe transparency in business matters now more than ever. To that end, your About Us
        page sets a standard for your transparency as a company overall.</p>

    <h4> Sharing values</h4>
    <p> Customers also want to know that the brands they support share their values. </p>

    <p> 84% of consumers worldwide said they’re more likely to buy from a brand with values that match their own. Your
        About Us page is the perfect place to lay out those values and what you stand for.</p>

    <h4> Connecting with customers</h4>

    <p> Writing an About page also helps you connect with customers, often during one of their first interactions with
        your brand. </p>
    <p>Reading your story, mission, values, and purpose will help them relate to your company.</p>

    <h4>Boosting your website’s E-A-T</h4>
    <p>In terms of SEO, creating an About page isn’t necessarily about ranking the page in search. </p>
    <p>Instead, it adds a layer of expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-A-T) to your site by explaining
        your background, your knowledge, and why you’re uniquely qualified to sell what you sell, offer the services you
        do, or discuss the topics you publish content about.</p>
